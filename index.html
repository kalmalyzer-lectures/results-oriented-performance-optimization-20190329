# Results-Oriented Performance Optimization

Mikael Kalms

CTO, Fall Damage

# Purpose of this session

We will practice optimization in a structured manner.

---

# What is optimization?

Optimization is the process of improving something.

How do you tell if something has improved?

It helps to have a **goal** to compare against.

It helps to have a **metric**, to measure progress toward the goal.

---

# Examples of goals + metrics

Any level in the game should load in <30 seconds on PS4.

The particle system must never use more than 300MB RAM.

The fog and mist should take <1ms but still look decent.

The game should be <1GB on-disk, decompression can use max 10MB temp RAM, load times can increase with <20%.

---

# Optimization is a tradeoff

Sometimes, improving one aspect helps in other aspects as well.

Sometimes, improving one aspect worsens another aspect.

---

# The "engineering definition" of optimization

"Make changes to a system...

...to reach an optimal balance between conflicting parameters...

...while observing hard constraints"

---

# What is a metric?

It is something that you can measure. Examples:

* load time for a level
* max memory usage during a play session
* Average packet transfer latency between two machines
* user enjoyment (1 = low, 5 = high) when playing through a level

---

# How to perform software optimization

Pick a goal.

Pick a metric that is relevant.

Change the code.

Measure how the metric has changed.

Repeat.

---

# Tips when measuring metrics

When you measure it, write it down. _Always._

If you measure the same thing many times, automate measurement + logging.
